\section{Introduction}
The rapid development of international trade and cross-border investment has promoted the foreign exchange (FX) market to be an increasingly critical component of the global economy. In international trade, the FX market not only provides the basis for currency exchange but also influences the pricing of goods, trade costs, and the competitiveness of businesses. However, uncertainties of exchange rate fluctuations have introduced significant risks and challenges to both international trade and investment.
