	Abstract = {Exchange rate fluctuations could influence economic activity not only via the standard trade channel, but also through a financial channel, which operates through the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on borrowers'balance sheets and lenders'risk-taking capacity. This paper explores the ``triangular''relationship between (1) the strength of the US dollar, (2) cross-border bank flows and (3) real investment. We conduct two sets of empirical exercises---a macro (country-level) study and a micro (firm-level) study. We find that a stronger dollar is associated with lower growth in dollar-denominated cross-border bank flows and lower real investment in emerging market economies. An important policy implication of our findings is that a stronger US dollar has real macroeconomic effects that go in the opposite direction to the standard trade channel.},
